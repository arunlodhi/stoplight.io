<div class="sl-help_section"><h1>Capturing / Logging HTTP Traffic<small>You can use StopLight to automatically log traffic passing through your local APIs.</small><small>You can also use StopLight to monitor other traffic on your computer, by using the proxy in transparent mode.</small></h1><p>First things first - a primer on the StopLight proxy. StopLight runs a proxy on your machine. By default, it runs the proxy on port 4010, although this is configurable. Any incoming requests to http://localhost:4010 will be forwarded to whatever you have set as your host. By default, this is http://localhost:3000. So, with the default setup, if you send a request to http://localhost:4010, it will be as if you are sending a request to http://localhost:3000. You can change these proxy settings by clicking on the <i class="fa fa-cog"></i> icon in the bottom left navigator. You can find more detail in the proxy documentation section.</p><p>Most apps/websites/libraries have a place in the codebase where you define the API host. Traditionally, this is used to support multiple environments (development, staging, production). If you update the host that your API consumer points to, to point to the StopLight proxy, you can start taking advantage of many StopLight features.</p><p>Let&#x27;s say that you are developing an Angular app, that connects with an API that lives at http://development-api.myapp.com. In this case, you would:</p><ol><li>Update your Angular app to connect with http://localhost:4010 (the StopLight proxy).</li><li>Set a stoplight variable called &quot;host&quot; (which is where the proxy forwards to) to &quot;http://development-api.myapp.com&quot;. To do this, click the <i class="fa fa-pencil"></i> icon in the bottom left navigator.</li><li>Make sure logging is turned on in the proxy settings.</li><li>Use your Angular app! The API traffic will be captured and shown in the entries resource list.</li></ol><div class="sl-help_img"><small>In this example, we have already updated our Todo application to send API requests through the proxy. We make sure our proxy host points to our API host (in this case, localhost:3000), logging is turned on, and then start using the app!</small><div class="sl-help_gif sl--on"><img src="https://images.stoplight.io/docs/http-capture.gif"/><div class="sl-help_gif_play f ai-c"><i class="fa fa-play"></i></div></div></div><h2>Transparent Traffic Capture</h2><p>Check out the proxy section on how to run transparently ;)</p></div>
