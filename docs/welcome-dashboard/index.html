<div class="sl-help_section"><h1>The Dashboard<small>You&#x27;re lookin at it!</small></h1><p>We designed the StopLight dashboard to maximize your productivity while building and working with APIs.</p><p>The dashboard is broken up in to three parts. In order, from left to right, we have the navigation bar, the resource list, and the main tabs container.</p><div class="sl-help_img"><img src="https://images.stoplight.io/docs/dashboard-overview.png"/></div><h2>1 - Navigator</h2><p>This is the dark, vertical bar, docked to the left side of the dashboard. The top half contains buttons to navigate the various resources that describe your APIs. The bottom half contains buttons to control the StopLight proxy, documentation links, and user links.</p><h2>2 - Resource List</h2><p>The resource list makes it easy to navigate through the various parts of your API. Clicking on anything in this list will open a new tab for that resource. Docked right above the list you will find a dropdown to manage and change your current project / environment. <b>Click the <i class="fa fa-minus-square-o"></i> button in the top left to collapse the resource list, and free up some screen space.</b></p><h2>3 - Tabs Container</h2><p>This area takes up most of the dashboard. You can open multiple tabs at the same time, of different types. This makes it easy to work on several parts of your API at once. Conveniences like drag and drop and right click to close all tabs are available!</p><h2>Shortcuts</h2><ul><li><code>command+t</code> New tab.</li><li><code>command+r</code> Reload StopLight.</li><li><code>command+s</code> If you have a tab open, save the resource.</li><li><code>option+command+left</code> Move left a tab.</li><li><code>option+command+right</code> Move right a tab.</li><li><code>command+k</code> If the proxy console is open, clear the console.</li></ul></div>
