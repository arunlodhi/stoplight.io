<div class="sl-help_section"><h1>Defining APIs in StopLight<small>Thorough, accurate definitions are the foundation of a good API. StopLight includes many utilities that make it easier to both define your API, and maintain those definitions.</small></h1><p>There are a few open API specifications that have emerged over the past several years. These include Swagger, RAML, and JSON Schema. We built StopLight with the intention of embracing and supporting these standards, not creating a new one. To that end, we will soon have importers and exporters for Swagger and RAML. In addition, much of our internal tooling, from validation, to definition generation, is built around a subset of JSON Schema. <b>When you define your API in StopLight, you are not locked in to StopLight.</b> We want to make your definitions complete, and portable.</p><h2>Terminology</h2><p><b>Workspaces:</b> An workspace is used to manage multiple projects, and includes team management features. This is also where you manage billing.</p><p><b>Projects:</b> 1 Project = 1 API. When a project is attached to an workspace you can add / remove team members, to work collaboratively on an API.</p><p><b>Environments:</b> A project has many environments. Right now, the main use case for environments is to scope variables. If you use variables within StopLight - wether it&#x27;s while sending requests, or defining endpoints - environments make it easy to switch between groups of variable definitions. Looking forward, we will introduce versioning and more powerful tooling around environments.</p><p><b>Endpoints:</b> An endpoint is the basic unit in your API definitions. It represents one method / url combination.</p><p><b>Schemas:</b> Schemas allow you to re-use JSON schemas across your definitions. You might use schemas to represent the various models in your API, and reference these schemas in your endpoint definitions.</p></div>
