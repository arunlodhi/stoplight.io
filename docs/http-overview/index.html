<div class="sl-help_section"><h1>Sending HTTP Requests</h1><p>You&#x27;ve fired up StopLight, now what? The simplest thing that you can use StopLight for is to debug APIs by sending HTTP requests. You can send these requests to your own APIs, to APIs you don&#x27;t control, to servers running on your computer (localhost, for example), or to servers available online.</p><div class="sl-help_img"><img src="https://images.stoplight.io/docs/http-overview.png"/></div><h2>1 &amp; 2 - Entries</h2><p>Hit the paper airplane in the navigator (1) to open your list of entries in the resource list (2). <b>An &quot;Entry&quot; comprises all of the data in a single HTTP request and response.</b></p><h2>3 - The Request Pane</h2><p>The left half of an entry tab contains all of the details of the outgoing request.</p><h2>4 - Request Details</h2><p>In this area you can tweak the basic parameters of your request. Change the headers, body, and authentication settings. You can use &lt;&lt;variables&gt;&gt;anywhere in this area - check out the variables section of the documentation for more info.</p><h2>5 - Code Generation</h2><p>The code generator will live update as you tweak the request you are trying to send. Easily switch to your language of choice, and then click the purple <i class="fa fa-copy"></i> button in the top right to copy the code for use in your app.</p><h2>6 - The Response Pane</h2><p>The right half of an entry tab contains all of the details of the incoming response. This pane will only be present if there is a response for the entry. If the entry hasn&#x27;t been sent yet, you won&#x27;t see this!</p></div>
