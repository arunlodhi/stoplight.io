<div class="sl-help_section"><h1>Endpoint Definitions<small>Endpoints are the basic definition unit you will use to describe your API. Each endpoint represents one HTTP Method + URL combination.</small></h1><h2>Defining a Basic Endpoint</h2><p>To define an endpoint, first make sure you have an active project. You can choose a project by clicking on the dropdown above the resource list on the left side of the dashboard. After selecting a project, press <code>command+t</code>, or click on the <i class="fa fa-plus-circle"></i> icon at the top of the tab container to create a new tab. From the new tab, click &quot;New Endpoint&quot;. That&#x27;s it, now we can start defining your endpoint!</p><p>The first thing you&#x27;ll want to do is give the endpoint a name, mehod, and url. The url should be relative, not absolute (just the path). You&#x27;ll define the host in a variable that is applied to the entire API. This is a more flexible approach to defining the API, and makes it easy to switch out the root location of your endpoints.</p><div class="sl-help_img"><small>Here we are defining a simple endpoint for the Github API.</small><img src="https://images.stoplight.io/docs/defining-endpoints1.png"/></div><h3>URL Parameters</h3><p>Note in the image above, the use of {username} in the endpoint path. This denotes a dynamic parameter in the URL.</p><p>Once you&#x27;ve filled in this basic info, you can press <code>command+s</code> or click the Create button at the top of the tab to create the endpoint.</p><h2>Endpoint Resource List</h2><p>As you define endpoints, they will show up in the endpoint resource list. To view this list, click the <i class="fa fa-bullseye"></i> icon in the top left navigator.</p><p>Within this resource list, you can create groups to better organize your API&#x27;s endpoint definitions. Simply click the + New Group button at the top of the pane, name the group, and hit the <i class="fa fa-check"></i>. Then you can drag and drop endpoints from group to group, within groups (except for the &quot;ungrouped&quot; group). You can also drag and drop groups themselves.</p><div class="sl-help_img"><img src="https://images.stoplight.io/docs/defining-endpoints4.png"/></div><h2>Endpoint Reference Section</h2><p>This is the first section shown upon opening an endpoint tab. Here, you can write a custom description to provide more detail on the endpoint&#x27;s functionality. The editor is <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">markdown</a> enabled.</p><p>You can include special, prebuilt documentation sections, by typing Endpoint.{sectionName} in the editor. These sections are automatically built from the endpoint&#x27;s definition. When you create a new endpoint, the reference includes all sections by default.</p><div class="sl-help_img"><small>Here we have defined 3 query string parameters, and 1 example response. As you can see, the reference automatically pulls our definitions, and formats them nicely for viewing.</small><img src="https://images.stoplight.io/docs/defining-endpoints2.png"/></div><h2>JSON Schema</h2><p>StopLight includes a nice visual editor to build your header, query string, request body, and response body definitions. Behind the scenes, this editor is simply creating a <a href="http://spacetelescope.github.io/understanding-json-schema/">JSON schema</a>. However, the editor does not support the entirety of the JSON schema spec. If you wish to use more advanced features of JSON schema, for validation, or otherwise, you can always edit the schema directly via the &quot;Schema&quot; tab.</p><h2>Building Endpoints from HTTP Requests</h2><p>StopLight can automatically stub out an endpoint definition from the result of an HTTP request. Simply make the request, and then click the &quot;Build Endpoint&quot; button at the top of the tab. StopLight will inspect all the details of the request and response to generate schemas for headers, query string, and bodies.</p><div class="sl-help_img"><small>Stubbing out the Github /users/{username}/repos endpoint.</small><div class="sl-help_gif sl--on"><img src="https://images.stoplight.io/docs/defining-endpoints3.gif"/><div class="sl-help_gif_play f ai-c"><i class="fa fa-play"></i></div></div></div></div>
